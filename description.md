write me a  short description of an Hadoop cluster-based ELTL (extract-load-transform-load) pipeline failover scenarios. Consider the following requirements while preparing the scenarios:
1.  this etl ingests data from a oracle database. It is written in python and bash. It uses Apace Hive to process and store data. 
2. Extract Phase: The ETL uses Apache sqoop to perfrom incremental-load and full-load of data from various database tables. 
3. Load Phase: Extracted data is loaded in various staging tables. From staging tables, data is also loaded in various temporary tables.
4. Transform-Load Phase: Various joining queries are run to create temporary tables. And from these temp tables, data is insert into final "gold" tables.

Failure in Oracle Database Connection:
If the connection to the Oracle database fails, the ETL process will not be able to extract data from the database. To remediate this, the ETL process can be configured to retry the connection after a certain period of time, and if it fails after multiple attempts, it can send a notification to the support team for further troubleshooting.

Failure during Sqoop Incremental or Full Load:
If a failure occurs during Sqoop Incremental or Full load, it can cause data inconsistency in the ETL process. To remediate this, the ETL process can use a backup strategy, such as saving the source data in a staging area or a backup cluster. This ensures that even if the ETL process fails, the original data is still available for processing.

Failure during Data Loading in Staging Tables:
If a failure occurs during data loading in staging tables, it can cause data loss. To remediate this, the ETL process can use transactional loading mechanisms such as ACID properties to ensure that the data is loaded correctly. Additionally, the ETL process can validate the data after loading to ensure that it is complete and accurate.

Failure during Hive Processing:
If a failure occurs during Hive processing, it can cause data inconsistency. To remediate this, the ETL process can use a backup strategy, such as saving the intermediate data in a staging area or a backup cluster. Additionally, the ETL process can implement a checkpoint mechanism to save the progress of data processing, and if a failure occurs, the ETL process can resume from the last checkpoint.

Failure during Transform-Load Phase:
If a failure occurs during the Transform-Load phase, it can cause data inconsistency in the final tables. To remediate this, the ETL process can use a backup strategy, such as saving the intermediate data in a staging area or a backup cluster. Additionally, the ETL process can implement a checkpoint mechanism to save the progress of data processing, and if a failure occurs, the ETL process can resume from the last checkpoint. The ETL process can also validate the data after loading to ensure that it is complete and accurate.

Overall, having a remediation plan in place for possible failure scenarios can help minimize the impact of failures on the ETL process, ensure data consistency, and improve the reliability of the pipeline.
